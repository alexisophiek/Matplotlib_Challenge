OBSERVATIONS

#1
Out of the all the drugs, Capomulin had a positive effect on the overall volume of the Tumor.  It decreased the total volume of the tumor by almost 20% at the end of the Trial Period.

#2
All three of the other Treatments either had little to no effect, or actually had inverse effects on the volume of the tumor. 

#3
The Metastatic Spread has a fairly consistant increase across the four drugs displayed.  The rate at which the spread occurs may also be in correlation to the actualy survival rate of the mice.  Capomulin still cheif among the four in overall effectivness.
